# Mission & Runtime Selection Style Information

## Selecting a Mission or Runtime

Selecting either a Mission or Runtime will have a direct affect on the opposite list. If a user selects a Runtime first, that will automatically disabled any Missions that are not compatible with that runtime. This is done by applying the `.disabled` class to `<div class="list-group-item list-view-pf-stacked list-view-pf-top-align">`. The same is done if the user selects a Mission first.
